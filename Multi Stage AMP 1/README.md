Designed a multistage amplifier to deliver an average power of at least 1 mW to a 820-ohm load from a voltage
source of 10 mV (amplitude) sinusoidal signal with 8 kohm internal resistance (Rs). Please use a 12-18 V DC
supply. Both BJT and MOSFET can be used. The output (Vout) needs to have a symmetric waveform in positive
and negative directions. Please show waveforms of Vout, both from simulation and oscillograph.
The low frequency 3dB (low-frequency cut-off) shall be 1kHz Â±2%. SPICE AC simulation should be used. In the
transfer function, the voltage gain (in dB) shows a slope of 20dB/DEC below 1000 Hz.

Includes LTSPICE simulation and physical breadboard implmentation.
