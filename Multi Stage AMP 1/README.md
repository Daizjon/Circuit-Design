Designed a multistage amplifier to deliver an average power of at least 1 mW to a 820-ohm load from a voltage
source of 10 mV (amplitude) sinusoidal signal with 8 kohm internal resistance (Rs). Used an 18 V DC
supply. Used two 2N3904 BJTs. The output (Vout) has a symmetric waveform in positive
and negative directions. The low frequency 3dB (low-frequency cut-off) is 1kHz Â±2%. In the transfer function, the voltage gain (in dB) shows a slope of 20dB/DEC below 1000 Hz.

Includes LTSPICE simulation and physical breadboard implmentation.
